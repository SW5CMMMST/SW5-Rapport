\chapter{System Requirements}
In general there exists two kinds of system requirements, functional requirements and non-functional requirements.
Functional requirements can be simplified to how a system should react when given certain input, or how it should react in certain situations.
Non-functional requirements can be simplified to being the constraints on the system, e.g. timing constraints or constraints created because of hardware.
For more information about these type of requirements read Ian Sommerville 2015. \cite{SEBook}

For this project the functional requirements will then be the requirements which deal with how the system reacts to the messages being sent from Arduino to Arduino, and other functions like this.
The non-functional requirements are the requirements which deal with hardware constraints, e.g. packet losses, and reliability.

Functional requirements according to the information gathered in the analysis in \myref{Analysis} can be expressed as the following:
