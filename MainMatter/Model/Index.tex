\chapter{Validation and Implementation}
This chapter will first validate the design of the previous chapter, and afterwards an implementation of the design will be presented.

\section{Model Checking}

Model-checking consists of verifying whether or not certain properties hold for a given modelled system, or protocol, i.e. can the system deadlock or end up in other unwanted states.
Doing this by hand can be a faulty and exhaustive process, therefore tools have been invented to assist in this process. In the following sections the tool UPPAAL, which can be further read about in \cite{UPPAAL}, will be described and used to model and verify the protocol used in this project. 
The tools might not be able to accurately describe reality as there are made some assumptions, however using a tool like this is a great help in producing a correctly working protocol.
