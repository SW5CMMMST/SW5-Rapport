\section{The Model}
This section will showcase the model made to express the design from \myref{cha:Design}.
For simplicity the introduction of the model in this chapter has split the model into two parts, an initializing phase and the main loop.
The complete model can be seen in \myref{app:UPPAAL} along with the code for the global and local declarations, including the functions used throughout the model.

The first part to be shown will be the initialization, which can be seen on \myref{fig:UPPAAL_Intitialization}
