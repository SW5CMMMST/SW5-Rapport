\section{Adaptation of CCRC-Solution} % (fold)
\label{sec:adaptation_of_ccrc_solution}
Due to time constraints in regards to this project, the first order of business in the adaptation of the CCRC-solution to the CCUC-problem, is to choose a subset of the ideas presented in the previous sections.
This limitation is also imposed to ensure a more ``depth first'' approach where the selected ideas are thoroughly designed, validated and implemented.

As a consequence of that decision, the idea of message redundancy as presented in \myref[name]{sub:avoidance} will be subject to further design and validation during the CCUC-problem.

In order for the message redundancy to be introduced into the existing solution from the CCRC-problem, only minuscule changes must be applied.
\begin{enumberate}
    \item The transmission phase which takes $\delta_{comm}$, must be expanded to account for more transmissions of the same length; and
    \item the receiving phase must likewise be expanded.
\end{enumberate}
These relatively small changes must be validated and the increase in reliability, if any, will be presented.
However firstly the UPPAAL-model from \myref[name]{sec:themodel} must be adapted to express the CCUC-problem, i.e. the chance of missing a transmission from another device.
