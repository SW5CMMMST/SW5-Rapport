\chapter{Expanding to the CCUC-problem}\label{CCUC}
With the CCRC-problem solved it is time to move towards a problem that lies within the realm of reality, the CCUC-problem.
For the CCRC-problem the reality of wireless technology was warped with the assumption that communication is perfect.
For the CCUC-problem this assumption amongst a few others will be removed; as such certain aspects of the CCRC-solution will be adapted to fit the CCUC-problem.

This adaptation the the CCRC-solution must consider not just the chance for packet loss to occur, but also the effect.
As going from reliable to unreliable communication is the only change that occurs some parts stay the same; the remainder of this chapter will focus on the aspects of the CCRC-solution which do change.
