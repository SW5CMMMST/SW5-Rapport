\subsection{Package Loss and Damage Control}
As one cannot reach complete reliability one must consider the effect of a packet being lost.
While the effect of packet loss is different depending on what data is being transfered, for the protocol in this paper corrupt data will render the transmission useless.


Effects of packet loss:
Corrupt data; depends on the application; delayed information; not syncing;
\subsubsection*{Continous listening}
\subsubsection*{Bitfield Time-Slot ID}

Methods of Recovery/Avoiding jams/desync:
Keep listening - worked earlier, no drift/desync issues;;; How would this handle if device is next?
Bitmask ID index in msg, allows devices to know if others missed their packet, works for dead device detection as well.
