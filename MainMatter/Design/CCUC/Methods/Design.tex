Effects of packet loss:
Corrupt data; depends on the application; delayed information; not syncing;

Methods of Recovery/Avoiding jams/desync:
Keep listening - worked earlier, no drift/desync issues;;; How would this handle if device is next?
Bitmask ID index in msg, allows devices to know if others missed their packet, works for dead device detection as well.
