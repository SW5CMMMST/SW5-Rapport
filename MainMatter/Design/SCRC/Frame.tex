As mentioned in the \myref{GCRC:frame} the frame might have to be different in a strongly connected network.
In a strongly connected network there is likely to be leaf vertices as well as vertices with many edges, one might consider that the vertices with many edges, particularly a universal vertex, should have more than one slot per frame in the case where echoing data is relevant.
For that specification of the protocol the frame may look more like \myref{fig:StronglyCCFrame}.
