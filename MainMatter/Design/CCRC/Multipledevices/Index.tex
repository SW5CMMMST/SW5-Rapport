\chapter{Multiple Device Activation}\label{chap:MDA-CCRC}
So far the CCRC-solution has been developed with the assumption that devices can only be active one at a time if they are not part of a network.
The effect of this assumption is that there is no chance of multiple networks being created in range of each other, and there is no chance for two or more devices jamming each other while attempting to connect to an established network.
In this chapter this assumption is removed and the complications this brings will be solved in two chapters; one pertaining to the issue that occurs if no network exists i.e. creating of multiple networks, and another pertaining to the issue that occurs if a network already exists i.e. multiple devices simultaneously attempting to connect to an established network.
