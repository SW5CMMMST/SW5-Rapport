\section{Statistical Model Checking}
When a model rely on stochastic behaviours, such as randomness, its state-space grows exponentially (sometimes called a state-space explosion) therefore an exhaustive search determining whether some property holds is not possible in reasonable time. 
Instead one can estimate a percentage chance a property holds, within a given probability of uncertainty, with a Statistical Model Checker (SMC).

\label{fig:simpleSMC}
\end{wrapfigure}

To do this in UPPAAL there is an extension called UPPAAL SMC, a full tutorial is available here ``Uppaal SMC Tutorial''\cite{DBLP:journals/sttt/DavidLLMP15} by Alexandre David, Kim G. Larsen, Axel Legay, Marius Miku\v{c}ionis, Danny B\o gsted Poulsen.

In UPPAAL SMC there is a new type of edge, this is a weighted edge and is shown as a dashed line. 
An example of this can be seen in figure \myref{fig:simpleSMC}. 
The figure shows a simple UPPAAL SMC model, following the initial state there is a ``branch point'' from which there are two weighted edges.
The number by the weighted edges indicates the probability of the edge being fired, this simple concept allows UPPAAL SMC to do randomness without having to explore the full state-space, as it can run simulations taking each edge a number of times corresponding to their weights. 
This example simulates a coin toss, giving 50 \% chance of heads and 50 \% chance of tails. 

Additionally UPPAAL SMC can also draw several types of plots which shows what the chance of a given query being true after a given run duration is.

It is possible to set the statistical parameters for UPPAAL SMC, such as: Probability uncertainty, Probability of false negatives and Probability of false positives. 
Setting these parameters closer to zero will cause the time it takes to verify a query for a model to increase drastically, however it will also be more accurate. 

%Description of changes to the model in UPPAAL

\subsection*{Changes to the model}\label{subsec:changestoModel}

The UPPAAL model shown in \myref{sec:themodel} has gone through extensive changes to accommodate the challenges posed of multiple devices starting at the same time.
The complete model can be seen in the back of the project report printed on a piece of A3-paper, and it can also be found as specified in  \myref{UPPAAL-CCRC-Code}.


\paragraph{Jamming} can now occur since multiple devices are turned on at the same time, which means that more than one device is now able to transmit at the same time.
If two or more devices transmit at the same time, i.e. a jam, then none of the receiving devices will be able to receive any payloads, this is also mentioned in \myref[name]{subsubsec:RadioHead}, this needs to be modelled in UPPAAL. 

\paragraph{Multiple Start-up.}
In the previous model presented in \myref[name]{sec:verifyingTheModel} only one device was able to start at a time, as there was nothing to handle multiple devices starting at the same time.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Model/Screenshot_Of_Kill.PNG} 
    \caption{Graph showing the split node after not receiving, where there is a chance for the device to start over and kill the network.}
    \label{fig:Screenshot_Of_Kill} 
    \vspace{10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}
\noindent
This limitation will be removed in this model.
To stop devices from being alone in a network forever, a split node is made when nothing is received in a time slot, where the device is alone in the network, i.e. the \texttt{local\_n} of the device is equal to 2.
This split node has 2 outgoing edges, one edge which has a probability weight of 90, which makes the device go back into its main loop, and another edge with a probability of \texttt{kill\_chance} (10 \%), which make the device kill the network, and start listening again.
When this happens the exponential backoff method is used, which means for each time a device kills the network it will have a chance of listening for a longer period of time, according to the specification in the previous sections.
These are the changes needed, in order for the devices to start trying to connect to the same network instead of creating multiple networks.
\myref{fig:Screenshot_Of_Kill} shows the split node leaving the location after not receiving a transmission.

\paragraph{Multile Devices Connecting.}
The other problem is for when devices try to connect to the same network at the same time.
A verification loop has been created for the model, where all devices which attempted to join the network will listen for the number of devices acknowledging their request of joining the network.
If the amount of acknowledgements are lower than half of the devices in the network, they will also use the exponential backoff method, where they will wait for a random number of frames, in an increasingly larger range, with a cap of 31 frames (It only requires one acknowledgement in the CCRC, but this solutions is chosen, to easier expand to CCUC).
This is the only change needed for handling multiple devices connecting to the network, the specifics of the implementation of this on the model will not be presented in this section, but for the curious reader the specifics can be seen in the appendix section of the paper.

%New Queries using SMC

\subsection*{Verifying using SMC}

Some of the queries presented in the previous UPPAAL section, \myref[name]{sec:verifyingTheModel}, makes no sense for the new model as multiple networks should be running at the same time when the devices first start-up, and therefore checking if the value of \texttt{i} is the same for all devices in a certain state makes no sense.
When verifying using SMC then the queries will yield a probability of being true within a given confidence interval, rather than true or false as in the normal UPPAAL.
Therefore the queries will all be checking for the probability of them being true over time, when at least 3000 UPPAAL time units has passed.
The choice of 3000 time units is because this gives enough time for all devices to start-up, and at least as some of them should have started a network. 
It should be noted that the model uses time estimates which roughly translate to the time being used in each phase for the hardware used in this project, where a time-slot length is $\delta = 250\ ms$.

All the queries have been run with five devices in the system, and a confidence of 0.999.
All queries' cumulative probability is shown on \myref{fig:ConnectQueryTime}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=UPPAAL, title={This query asks for the probability that it is false that two devices which are connected have the same k, only if they are the same device.

This means that the devices are connected to the same network. UPPAAL runs this query and within 3451 runs [0.998,1] with confidence 99.9 \% this is true. The query had a run-time of 46 seconds. }]
2. Pr[<=300000] ( <> forall(i : id_t) forall(j : id_t) (time > 3000)

This query ensures that all the \texttt{k}-values are within the wanted range after a network is made. UPPAAL runs this query and within 3451 runs [0.998,1] with confidence 99.9 \% this is true.

    and (Device(i).local_n == N+1) 
    and (Device(i).Done_Transmitting 
    imply (Device(j).Just_Received or i==j)))
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
\myref{fig:ConnectQueryTime} shows a graph of all the queries.
As can be seen the change in probability for the new model approaches one as time increases, and appears to be a logarithmic growth.
So according to UPPAAL the new model will eventually connect all the devices, however it might take some time for it to do so.
In the worst case the random numbers generated will keep causing collisions, however this happening is very unlikely. 
It it important to note that the longer the devices are running the greater the probability is of establishing a stable network.

  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/Graphs/gnuplot/uppaal/graph.pdf} 
\caption{Graph of the UPPAAL SMC queries, in which the cumulative probability increase over time. With 99.9 \% confidence and five devices.}
\label{fig:ConnectQueryTime}
\end{figure}

\bigskip
\noindent
A comparison has been made for this model with the previous model in \myref{sec:themodel}, while allowing the devices to start at the same time.
Query 4 can be run on both models, but on the older simpler model it will, when run with five devices, yield the result [0.0, 0.019], which means that it will probably never succeed.
So a change to the models allow the devices to leave the initial location at any moment between 0 and 30000 UPPAAL time units, and different results occur; the devices will now sometimes have enough interval between activation so that a stable network will be created in the older model. 
30 000 has been chosen as it leaves a big time period for devices to start-up in, which means that a successful network will be created.
The probability result is [0.75,0.77], if the start-up time was greater it would result in a higher probability.
Therefore this shows that if the devices are started with an interval in the old model, there still is a reasonable success rate, but as soon as they start at the same time, it does not work. 
The changes are the same for both models and can be seen on \myref{lst:startuptimeChanceListing}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=UPPAAL, caption={Change in thestart-up time for devices.}, label={lst:startuptimeChanceListing}, float=h]
//Original
int Start-up_Time = Initial_Wait_Time*2;

//Change
int Start-up_Time = Initial_Wait_Time*20;
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
\noindent
The old model performs significantly worse that the new one, and will not always reach a stable correctly created network, and this is as mentioned only possible whenever there is a interval between activation of the devices.

Starting each device separately with a time interval causes an increase in speed for the new model, and ensures that the old model will succeed in some cases, therefore the new model has also been changed for the sake of this comparison. 
To compare these two models query number 4 is used, the result is shown in \myref{CompareGraph}.
The old model has a cut-off point at $30 000$ UPPAAL time units, this
