\section{Conclusion}
This chapter presented a way to handle the startup of multiple devices, which made use of the method exponential backoff, which results in an increasingly randomly generated number of wait time for the devices. 
The randomness results in all devices eventually becoming connected to the network since they will be split up and thus stop jamming each other.
The UPPAAL model created data, which can be seen on \myref{fig:ConnectQueryTime}.
The data shows that the Arduinos will eventually be connected to the same network, however it does take some time, approximately $150 000$ UPPAAL time units.
This means that an implementation of this design should be able to solve the issues of turning on more Arduinos at the same time, assuming our assumptions are correct.
