\section{Testing on Arduino}\label{sec:ccrc_test}
\todo[inline]{Har ingen ide om hvad der skal ske i denne section - Troels}
The solution for the Simultaneous Connect Problem described in \myref[name]{sec:simultaneous_connect} have been implemented on the Arduino platform.
This is to test if it works in a real life scenario. 

Only the Simultaneous Connect Problem of the \myref[name]{chap:MDA-CCRC} have been implemented, this is done because of its complicity and because of time-constraints.

The test consisted of four devices and the following method was used:
\begin{eletterate}
	\item Start a single device.
	\item After a small timer period start the other three.
	\item Log timestamps for when each device joins.
\end{eletterate}

This resulted of the test is shown in \myref{tab:ccrc_test}.
It shows that out of the five test runs, the lowest time it took to make a network of all devices took $13 358$ milliseconds and the highest took $31 959$ milliseconds.
The average was $18780$ and the median $17131$.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The \myref[name]{sec:simultaneous_connect} which was confirmed to be working in UPPAAL SMC also works on Arduinos.
