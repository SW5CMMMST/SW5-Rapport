\subsection{Creating a network}
When first turning on a device, which should be part of the network, the first task of the device must be to try to connect to an existing network.
First the device will be set to listening for any signal for a given time period. 
If the device does not pick up any transmission during this period the device will start initialising its own network.

When a device creates a network, the network contains two times slots; one for the device itself and one empty slot, which allows another device to connect to the network.
When the frame is in the device's own time slot it will transmit so new devices can detect said network, when they are listening in their start-up period.
