\subsection{Payload}
When developing for an Arduino it is important to design for the limited memory available.
Therefore it is advised to keep the amount of memory used small.
Additionally the transmission time increases as the size of the payload increases, this will further increase the risk of package loss. 
Thus the smallest payload which could accomplish the task needed is preferred.
 
The amount of data in the payload largely depends on the complexity of the network itself, and the devices that make up the network.
An example would be a sensory network which observe one thing, e.g. a fire alarm. 
The only variable required here, aside from those used for communicating, is whether or not a fire has started, which would result in very little data transmission.

This is one use case, however more complex networks should also be supported. 
In an effort to allow for such a variety in networks an abstraction of the data will be made, and as such the only consistent data being sent in a transmission will be the information needed for communicating on the network.
A figure showing the design of the payload can be seen on \myref{fig:payload_struct}.

The payload has the three variables: Current Slot, Slot Count and Address, which are used to communicate in the network.
The current slot is used to indicate which slot the frame is currently in, while slot count is the total number of slots.
The address is an address which is unique to each device. 
The payload allows the protocol to abstract from what data is being sent, and as such any data can be send as long as it is of reasonable size. 

Examples of data could be sending a message to turn on some LED or maybe requesting sensor data from other devices.
Address is much like a mac address and is unique for all Arduinos, and is used to differentiate between Arduinos to tell them apart.
This could instead be included in the Data as some implementations with the protocol might not need to differentiate between the Arduinos, however this is a more general solution for the protocol.
Since the size of the address is finite, and will most likely be implemented as a 1 byte unsigned integer. 
A 1 byte address would allow 256 addresses, however a few may be reserved for special uses.
This header is reasonably small with a size of 3 bytes, and the size of the data field will depend on the user code on the device.
