\section{Protocol}
The design and development of a protocol is based on its purpose.
For the protocol documented in this paper, the primary objective is to create a \acrlong{ccrc} network of Arduinos i.e. a network of Arduinos able to communicate with an arbitrary number of devices and allowing devices to join or leave. \todo{Vi skriver leave her, er det med henblik p√• device removal? eller skal det fjernes herfra? - Troels}

The protocol should be general in purpose, with the possibles of using it for different use cases.
This should be achieved by designing the protocol as a library and thus allowing user-code for the specific use cases.
The design of the protocol will be described top-down, so the first element designed will be the frame, thereafter the time-slots, which a frame consists of and finally the payload which is transmitted in the time-slots. 

At this point in the development of the protocol it is assumed that no two devices will start within a critical period of time (i.e. a multiple of the time it takes to send a message).
To make sure that only one device will attempt to create a network at the same time, and only one device will attempt to connect to an existing network at the same time.
