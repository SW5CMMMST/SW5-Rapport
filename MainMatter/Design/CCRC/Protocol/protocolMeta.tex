\section{Protocol}
The design and development of a protocol is based on its purpose.
For the protocol documented in this paper, the primary objective is to create a completely connected reliable communication network of Arduinos i.e. a network of Arduinos able to communicate with an arbitrary number of devices and allowing devices to join or leave.
The protocol should be general in purpose, with the possiblites of using it for different usecases.
This should be archieved by designing the protocol as a libary and thus allowing usecode for the specific usecases.

The design of the protocol will be topdown, so the first element designed will be the frame, thereafter the timeslots, which a frame consists of and finally the payload which is transmitted in the timeslots.
