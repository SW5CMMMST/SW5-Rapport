\section{Protocol}
The development of a protocol is influenced by the purpose of the protocol.
For the protocol documented in this paper, the primary objective is to create a completely connected reliable communication network of Arduinos i.e. a network of Arduinos able to communicate with an arbitrary number of devices and allowing devices to join or leave.
The protocol should general in purpose, with the possiblites of using it for different usecases.
This should be archieved by designing the protocol as a libary and thus allowing usecode for the speicfic usecases.

For this protocol it is assumed that no two devices will start within a critical period of time.
To make sure that only one device will attempt to create a network at the same time, and only one device will attempt to connect to an existing network at the same time.
