\section{Protocol}
The design and development of the protocol are based on its purpose.
For the protocol documented in this paper, the primary goal is to create a \acrlong{ccrc} network of Arduinos i.e. a network of Arduinos able to communicate with an arbitrary number of devices and allowing devices to join.
The protocol should be general in purpose, with the possibles of using it for different use cases.
This should be achieved by designing the protocol as a library and thus allowing user-code for the specific use cases.
The design of the protocol will be described top-down, so the first element designed will be the frame, thereafter the time-slots, which a frame consists of and finally the payload which is transmitted in the time-slots.
