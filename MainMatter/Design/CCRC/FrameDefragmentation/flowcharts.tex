\section{Additions to the Flowchart}
These changes are to be put into the flowchart from \myref{fig:main_psuedo_flow}.

The first flowchart, \myref{fig:jd1}, is necessary for the fist and last device to monitor if they should change the frame, here the last device increments a counter for each device from which it does not receive a payload.
\tikzfigure{DefragmentationFlowchart_1.tikz}{The needed changes to main loop, to count which devices misses their times-slot.}{jd1}

The second flowchart, \myref{fig:jd2}, is the jump itself.
If the counter for any timeslot is higher than $m_{max}$, then it should change its $k$ to the $k$ of the device which missed counter was higher than $m_{max}$.
This makes the last device of the frame now have a new k, and thus it has performed the jump.

The third flowchart, \myref{fig:jd3}, shows how to handle the last device of the frame leaving.
