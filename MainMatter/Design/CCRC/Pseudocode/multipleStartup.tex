\subsubsection*{Multiple Startup Issue/Problem/Complication}
A major complication that may be encountered when starting a device is the possibility of multiple devices starting at once.
In order to guarentee a working network starts the devices cannot both create a network at the same time or they will simply be jammming each other such that no new device will ever join.
The CCRC-problem has till now assumed perfect communication as the first priority is guarenteeing that a network can be established and transmit messages in an established network.
As such for the CCRC-problem another assumption will be added, only one device will be turned on at a time, which in turn makes this problem irrelevant.
The CCUC-problem focuses more on guarentees of communication in the network and will in keeping with that also consider this issue.
