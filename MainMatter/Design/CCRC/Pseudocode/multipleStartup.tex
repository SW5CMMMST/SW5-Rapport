\subsubsection*{Multiple Startup Issue}\label{msiCCRC}
A major complication that may be encountered when starting a device is the possibility of multiple devices starting at once.
In order to guarantee a working network starts the devices cannot create a network at the same time or they will simply be jamming each other such that no new device will ever join.
The CCRC-problem has until now assumed perfect communication as its first priority is guaranteeing that a network can be established and transmit messages in an established network using single frequency transmitters and receivers.
As such for the CCRC-problem another assumption will be added, only one device will be turned on within a frame, which in turn nullifies this issue.
The CCUC-problem focuses more on the uncertainties of communication in the network and will in keeping with that also consider this issue.
