\subsection{Startup} % (fold)
\label{sub:setup} 
While the network will spend most of its run time executing \texttt{mainLoop()} occasionally special case procedures are required, one of these is \texttt{startup()}.
This procedure is run when a device is turned on, reset or for some other reason may not be part of a network. 
\texttt{startup()} performs the initial setup of the device, this includes searching for a network or establishing its own network if no network can be detected, a flow diagram of how this process is handled can be seen in \myref{fig:psuedo_flow}.

\bigskip \noindent
In \myref{lst:setup} a new local variable is introduced, $t_0$, this constant decides when the device should give up listening for a network and instead establish a network.
For the completely connected reliable communication case represented in \myref{chp:Problems} $t_0$ has to be at least the length of $2 \times \delta + \delta_{com}$, however it being slightly longer taking guard time and the chance of a slight miss synchronization into consideration $3 \times \delta$ will be considered the minimum.
The minimum is calculated from the case where the device is turned on after the $n-1$'th slot has started, but not yet ended.
It is worth noting here that this minimum is only true for this case, both strongly connected and non-reliable communication present their own reasons for this not being true for those cases.

If a network is found prior to \textit{x} exceeding $t_0$ the device will process the data and use this to properly attain a slot in the network as is seen on lines 7 - 9 in \myref{lst:setup}.
Should it occur that no network is found the device will start its own network with the initial configuration that lines 14 - 16 in \myref{lst:setup} shows.
