\subsection{Creating a network}
\todo{WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SUBSECTION DOING HERE?}
When first turning on a device which should be part of the network, the first task of the device must be to try to connect to an existing network, if this does not succeed it is assumed that the device is the first and should therefor self set up a new network.
In the following text the design of creating a network will be further described.

First the device will be set to listening for any signal in twenty seconds. 
If the device does not pick up any transmission during this period the device will start initialising it's own network, which other devices then can connect themselves to.

When device starts to create a network, the device will start a network with two times slots, one for the device itself and one empty slot which allows another device to connect to the network.
The device will the send a message signalling an ok status, if it has nothing else to send, so other devices can see the network.
