\section{Simultaneous Connect}
As described in \myref[name]{sec:simultaneous_connect} the protocol handles the difficulties that arise with respect to simultaneous connect by trying to connect in the empty slot, listen for validation and wait an exponential backoff if validation is not acquired and then try again.

This section will present an alternative solution which is designed to better handle when many devices tries to connect simultaneously.
To improve the likelihood of a device connecting in the first frame the idea of sub slots is introduced and explained in the following text.

\subsection{Introduction of Sub Slots} % (fold)
\label{sub:introduction_of_sub_slots}
To ensure faster solving of conflicts if multiple devices try to connect simultaneously a random offset of sub slots to wait in the empty slot is used.
The empty-slot is split into 3 parts, which can be done since all a device needs to transmit to announce itself is the address of itself.
A device randomly choose a sub-slot to announce in, and if it is not the device's sub-slot it will receive any transmissions. 
If a transmission is received while in a sub-slot the device will go back and listen while waiting for the next empty-slot.
This can be seen on \myref{fig:pseudo_flowMultiConnectimp} which is the flowdiagram from \myref[name]{sec:simultaneous_connect} expanded with the idea of sub-slots.

\end{figure}

The following paragraphs will address the aforementioned concepts of random offset and sub slots more thoroughly as well as an altered payload which aims to decrease the length of the empty slot.

\subsubsection{Random Offset}\label{roff}
When a device is announcing itself in the empty slot it randomly chooses an offset for when to transmit the announcement payload.
The random offset is not defined by time but sub slots. 
In the rest of the empty slot it listens for other possible devices announcing themselves.
If such a message is heard it does not attempt to announce itself in a later sub slot of the empty slot.
This method implies that the length of empty slot is a multiple of the time it takes to transmit the announcement payload.

\subsubsection*{Announcement Payload}\label{apay} % (fold)
\label{ssub:announcements}
To minimise the time it takes to announce oneself to a network a special announcement payload is introduced.
This payload only needs one field namely the unique identifier or address of the device which is sending it.
By shortening the payload significantly from the regular size down to 1 byte the time it takes to transmit the payload is decreased, thus allowing several of such packages to be sent in a normal time-slot.

\subsubsection{Sub-slots} % (fold)
\label{ssub:sub_slots}
To avoid using the potentially time consuming exponential backoff, if a multiple of devices try to connect simultaneously, the empty slot will be partitioned into smaller sub slots, see \myref{fig:frame_wsubslots} for illustration. 
The length of a sub slot should be slightly longer than the time it takes to transmit an announcement payload; it is important not to have overlapping announcements since none of them would be heard due to jamming.

When determining how many sub-slots the empty slot should be partitioned into, it should be considered that more sub-slots will increase the overall frame length, and it has been set to three because it is a a good fit, since it takes approximately $\delta_{comm}$-time to transmit three times with the payload of a size of one.

\noindent
This method would in most cases perform faster connection of multiple new devices than the solution in \myref[name]{sec:simultaneous_connect} however when comparing the added value in regards to the added cost, the simpler method from \myref{chap:MDA-CCRC} is the better choice when considering our time-constraints.
