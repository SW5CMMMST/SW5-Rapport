\section{Other components}
This subsection briefly covers some of the other components for the project.
\subsubsection{Light Emitting Diode}
A \textbf{Light Emitting Diode} (\textbf{LED}) is a small light-source which can come in a variety of different colours including those hidden from the human eye such as infrared and ultraviolet.
The LED is connected to electricity through an anode (often the long leg) and a cathode (short leg), once connected current flows and the LED to emits light.
They typically require very little power.

\subsubsection{Switch}
Another relatively simple piece of hardware used is a switch.
The switches mentioned throughout this paper establish a connection between two disconnected conductors when held down, allowing a flow of electrons to pass through the switch.
This can be read by the Arduino and used as an input device.
