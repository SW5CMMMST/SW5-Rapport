\section{Arduino}\label{sec:arduino}
Arduino is a company which designs and produces open source hardware and software.
This means that anyone who would like to, can copy their hardware design and even make their own improvements.
This also means that there are many copies of the hardware with no significant changes sold at a cheaper price compatible with the free Arduino software.
The software used to program Arduino boards will be explained in \myref[name]{sec:software}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[floatplacement=b,float,colback=white!5,colframe=aaublue!50,title=The Birth of the Arduino \cite{birthofarduino}.]
In 2005 a group of students, at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Italy, developed the Arduino board as a project, so there would be a cheaper alternative to the ``BASIC Stamp'' (another microcontroller-based development kit), used by the institute at the time, which cost roughly \$100.

\subsubsection{Arduino Uno}
The Arduino Uno is an ATmega328P based micro-controller board, with a footprint of about five by seven centimetres.
It has a total of 20 pins where most are digital input/output pins.
Most pins have some predefined functions which support a variety of different communication standards. 
None of these pins are relevant as this project will just use pins for I/O. \todo{Er det stadig irrelevant?}
A program can be uploaded through a USB connection, which can also power the Arduino, and provide a debugging interface through serial communication.

The ATmega328P processor, has 32 KB of flash memory, 2 KB of SRAM, 1 KB of EEPROM, and a clock speed of 16 MHz.
EEPROM is a small persistent memory section, where stored data is kept when the devices are turned off, more on this can be found in \cite{EEPROM}.

These specifications pose some rather serious constraints in respect to speed, memory and storage, and are in great contrast to the majority of today's programming practises where e.g. plenty of memory is more or less a given.
