In computer science a protocol is a set of procedures for transmitting data between two or more devices.
In order for this transmission to succeed there must be a mutual agreement between all devices on how data is transmitted and received.
This agreement determines a wide variety of conditions such as size of data packets, among others that will be further described in this section.
An example for a protocol would be \textbf{Transmission Control Protocol} (\textbf{TCP}) which is one of the main protocols used in the internet protocol suite.
In this section a variety of possibilities for each part of developing a protocol will be analysed as to then be used for the design and implementation of the protocol starting on ---.\todo{insert reference here once reference is created}
