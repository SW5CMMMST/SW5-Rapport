\subsection{Ad Hoc Networks}
Unlike a traditional network which rely on hardware like routers for routing the traffic between devices, ad hoc networks only relies on the devices connected to the network and thus relying on these devices for maintaining data exchange throughout the network.
This creates interesting problems which need to be considered when building an ad hoc network.

\medskip
As stated before there exists no routers in ad hoc networks, therefore every node must be of the type transceiver, that will say it both function as a receiver and a transmitter.
One common algorithm used in ad hoc networks to propagate a massage  throughout the system is the flooding algorithm.
There exist varieties of the flooding algorithm but the general idea is have every node resend a package to every connected node, except to node from which the package was received.

Ad hoc networks ca either be strongly or loosely connected, this together with the use case of the network can be important when designing the structure of the ad hoc network.
