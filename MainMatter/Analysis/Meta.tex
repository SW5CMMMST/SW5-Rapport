The following part of the paper will describe, analyse and evaluate the initiating problem, which concerns the difficulties of having multiple embedded systems communicate on the same radio frequency.
Furthermore, some of the possible solutions to the problem including hardware, software and techniques will be introduced and discussed.
It could make sense to use more frequencies to communicate with so that multiple channels could be communicating at the same time.
However, a problem arises when there is many devices, because we will run out of frequencies at some point, so therefore the problem of solving how multiple devices communicate on the same frequency is still an important issue to solve in this project.
Finally the part will end in a problem statement in \myref{sec:problemStatement} which will be used in the design phase of this project.
