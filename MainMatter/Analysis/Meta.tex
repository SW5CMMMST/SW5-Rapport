The following part of the paper will describe, analyse and evaluate the problem defined in \myref[name]{sec:problemStatement}, which concerns the difficulties of having multiple embedded systems communicate on the same radio frequency.
Furthermore, some of the possible tools, including hardware, software, and techniques, which could be used to solve the problem will be introduced and discussed.
It could make sense to use more frequencies to communicate with so that multiple channels could be communicating at the same time.
However this is not a solution as it merely postpones the problem due to the fact that at some point we will run out of frequencies. 
Therefore the problem of solving how multiple devices communicate on the same frequency is seen as an important issue to explore.
