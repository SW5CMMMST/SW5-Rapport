This chapter will describe, analyse and evaluate the difficulties of having multiple embedded systems communicate on the same radio frequency.
Furthermore, some of the possible solutions to the problem including hardware, software and techniques will be introduced and discussed.
But first the reasoning for choosing to use one frequency will be given.
It could make sense to use more frequencies to communicate with so that multiple channels could be communicating at the same time.
However, a problem arises when there is many devices, because we will run out of frequencies at some point, so therefore the problem of solving how multiple devices communicate on the same frequency is still an important issue to solve.
