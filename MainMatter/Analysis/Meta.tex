The following part of the paper will describe, analyse and check the problem defined above, which concerns the difficulties of having many embedded systems communicate on the same radio frequency.
Furthermore, some of the possible tools, including hardware, software, and techniques, which could be used to solve the problem will be introduced and discussed.
It could make sense to use more frequencies to communicate with so that many channels could be communicating at the same time.
But, this is not a solution as it postpones the problem since at some point we will run out of frequencies. 
So, the problem of solving how many devices communicate on the same frequency is seen as an important issue to explore.
