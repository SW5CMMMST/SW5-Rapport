The weakest part of the system would be the time critical part.
As currently, the total duration of a frame would be $(n + 1) \times \delta$ where $n$ is the number of devices and $\delta$ is the slot length.
With our tests with only 6 devices and a $\delta$ of 200 miliseconds.
This would result in a frame length af 1.4 seconds.
This grows linear with the number of devices, which would result in slow responsetime for larger networks.
