\chapter{Conclusion}

The work in the project resulted in a protocol where each device takes turns to communicate in a cyclic manner with an empty slot where empty.

%The work in the project worked on single frequency networks. %Might be stating a new thesis

How can a network of devices with radio transceivers of a single frequency communicate, such that any devices can send messages to other devices in the network, in a reliable and time-critical way?

As the models have shown the network created by the protocol will be reliable by almost always sending the correct message after a period.


In doing that the protocol sacreficed some of the time critical aspect as they always wait before sending.
As currently, the total duration of a frame would be $(n + 1) \times \delta$ where $n$ is the number of devices and $\delta$ is the slot length.
With our tests with only 6 devices and a $\delta$ of 200 miliseconds.
This would result in a frame length af 1.4 seconds.
This grows linear with the number of devices, which would result in slow responsetime for larger networks.

This work could be a step towards making an easier way to setup local networks.
For example imagine a world where when taking a device home the setup process would be as easy as powering it on.
Then it would figure out what todo about the local network.
This would not only be useful in home automation, but also in
