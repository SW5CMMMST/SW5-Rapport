%ProblemStatement
Throughout this paper, efforts to find a solution to the problem statement in \myref{sec:problemStatement} has been made.
Which in short is to develop a protocol for multiple devices to communicate over a single radio frequency in a reliable and time-critical way, without jamming each other.
In order to develop a protocol for this particular problem a choice in hardware was made, which was to use the Arduino.

% Hardware
Using the Arduino platform limits the hardware and computational options although as the protocol would require neither intense computation or powerful hardware; the Arduino platform proved to be a good fit for the purpose of this paper and the resources available.
For real world applications unreliability is also a factor to consider and \gls{rf}-modules are no exception, furthermore as the problem statement states cost-efficiency, cheaper \gls{rf}-modules are chosen which in turn affects the quality.

% Problems: CCRC CCUC SCRC SCUC
\bigskip \noindent
The project group used graph theory to split the problem domain into four separate issues, in order to handle one sub-problem at a time, these are \acrfull{ccrc}, \acrfull{ccuc}, \acrfull{scrc}, and \acrfull{scuc}, which can all be further read about in \myref{chp:Problems}.

% TDMA
The design of the protocol is based on the concept \acrfull{tdma}.
Which is the state-of-the-art protocol for single-frequency multiple device communication.

% CCRC
UPPAAL was used to check if the protocol uphold different statements and queries.
The first protocol successfully arranged all devices into a network, where no two devices would transmit at the same time, thus causing no jamming.

% Multistartup & Results UPPAAL
The first design intended for \acrshort{ccrc} did not handle the activation of multiple devices at the same time, as shown by UPPAAL.
The project group split the multiple device activation problem into two sub-problems: \myref[name]{sec:MSI-CCRC} and \myref[name]{sec:simultaneous_connect}.
This was not in the original plan, and the time it took to design and implement this was underestimated, which caused time-constraints in the end.

% Results Implementation
The protocol was implemented to work on the Arduinos and a test showed that if one Arduino had made a network, and three other Arduinos were turned on at the same time, a network was successfully created.
The part of the protocol from \myref[name]{sec:MSI-CCRC} has not been implemented, but it has been shown by UPPAAL that the protocol works as intended.

% Design CCUC
For the \acrshort{ccuc}-protocol not much had to change for it to still work properly.
It was discovered using UPPAAL that it was only creating and connecting the network, which causes problems in \acrshort{ccuc}, when a network was created, the protocol still had a high probability of success.
It was chosen that transmitting twice every time a transmission should be transmitted could increase this probability.
UPPAAL was used to check this hypothesis, and it showed that this was actually the case, as can be seen in \myref[name]{sec:uppaalccuc}.
% Results UPPAAL

% Optimisations
%   Delete, Multi-Subslots
% Time-constraints -> Not made all of the design
Further optimisations to the protocol were designed in \myref[name]{mortenStuff}, but were not implemented, due to time-constraints posed by the unforseen time it took to develop multiple startup of devices.
These included a way to remove \enquote{dead} devices, and defragmenting the frame to make the frame length the smallest possible.

% If more time Future works.
\bigskip \noindent
If time was not a factor the next step for the project would be the implementation of strongly connected networks.
The strategies for designing these will be explained in the following chapter.
