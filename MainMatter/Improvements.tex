\chapter{Improvements to the Protocol}
In this chapter different design considerations which could improve the protocol in different aspects, will be presented.

The solutions presented herein are not implemented in the actual protocol based on a assessment that their enhancement of the protocol is not important enough considering the limited time available for the protocol development. 
They are however seen as possible improvement over the current protocol and are therefore presented in this chapter.
