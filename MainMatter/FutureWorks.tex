\chapter{Future Works}
This chapter describes the problems whose solutions could help in better solve the problem statement as stated in \myref{sec:problemStatement}. 
Most of these were excluded due to time constraints.

\section{Strongly Connected Networks}
During the analysis phase of the project, an issue came up what if the network is not complete? 
Many of the techniques from the unreliable networks would work in most cases. 
For example when connecting to a network. 

An incomplete network is a network where the individual devices might not have a direct connection to every other device in the network. 
This complicates communication between devices.

In this case, the other devices in the network must figure out whether to act as a relay for a message. 
The simple solution is to repeat all known information. 
This would make the message length long and by that account also the frame length. 
Communication would become slow.

A worst case for a network of four devices is illustrated by \myref{fig:linearNetwork}.
When device 1 wants to send a message to device 4, the message needs to go through device 2 and 3 first.

The implementation of this would allow many other use cases for the protocol. 

\section{Interrupt based library}

The Arduino platform includes support for interrupt based programming.
This means that every $\delta$ milliseconds an interrupt in the user program could occur.
In this interrupt the protocol specific details could be handled, such as transmitting and reciving.

The main advantage of this would be that the timer gives a better guarrentee that the user code will not exceed the expected duration.
The disadvantage of this would be that the interface could become less obvious, and it would make the code vunerable to race conditions.

Another thing to note is that on the Arduino Nano and Uno there are three timer interrupts.
One is used by the delay function another is used by radiohead leaving exactly one left for the protocol.
This would mean that every other library which uses timers would be uncompatible, unless RadioHead and the protocol could share interrupt.
But this would require a lot of changes to both libraries.
