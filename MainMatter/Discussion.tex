\chapter{Discussion}
How realistic is the assumptions made for protocol? Particularly the CC scenario in constrast to the SC scenario

Realistic application use - consider length of a frame

Success of the project, practical example


Do your results provide answers to your testable hypotheses? If so, how do you interpret your findings?
Do your findings agree with what others have shown? If not, do they suggest an alternative explanation or perhaps a unforseen design flaw in your experiment (or theirs?)
Given your conclusions, what is our new understanding of the problem you investigated and outlined in the Introduction?
If warranted, what would be the next step in your study, e.g., what experiments would you do next?

Disc: Intro to nao

Problem, alrdy solved so why bother?
Hardware choice
Hardware tests, point and outcome
Math models, why the split?
Reqs, where they met? how well?
CCRC alot more its than expected
Edge cases
CCUC addition so slight, why bother splitting UC and RC?
UPPAAL to real code how?
Real code how does it even work

UC expansion
Double send, value?
Alternatives
Things that were designed but not implemented
