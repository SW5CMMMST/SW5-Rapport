\section{Model Driven Software Development}
Because, reliability is the main focus points of the protocol.
It is essential that it is possible to test the model in-depth during development.

Model driven software development is one way to make this possible.
The general idea is that the model is more abstract than its implementation.
Therefore a programmer could write a model and have another program generate the code and any errors in the generated code is caused by the model itself or an error in the model to code compiler.
Changes in the generated code should therefore be avoided.

Because a model is more abstract than the implementation, it is feasible that another program could simulate devices using the protocol.
The result would be the possibility of testing a larger array of cases in a short period of time compared to tests using hardware.

In pure model driven software development it would usually involve a generator which could generate code from the model. 
This is not the focus of this paper, therefore,
