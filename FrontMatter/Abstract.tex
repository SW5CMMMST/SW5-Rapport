This paper explores the possibilities of designing and implementing a wireless single frequency communication protocol for embedded devices using cheap \acrshort{rf}-modules.
A simple protocol is designed and further expanded to account for scenarios which can arise in a real-world setting.

\medskip
The hardware is tested in regards to reliability; the protocol is designed in regards to a naive scenario and iterated upon to account for more realistic scenarios.
Each scenario is implemented as a model in UPPALL tool to verify the validity of the design and to calculate probabilities of successful networks being established.
The design is implemented onto Arduino devices with attached RF-modules.

\medskip
The protocol is not specified to any distinct use case and allows for user-code to be run alongside the protocol as well as modifiable payloads to allow for different use cases such as a fire alarm network or home automation.
