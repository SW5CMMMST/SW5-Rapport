This paper explore the possibilities of designing, model checking and implementing an wireless single frequency communication protocol for embedded devices on cheap RF modules.
During the paper a simple protocol is designed and then further expanded to account for many problems which arises in real world settings.

The hardware is tested in regards o reliability and the protocol is designed and is then implemented as a model in UPPALL tool to verify the correctness of the design and to calculate probabilities of successful networks.
The design is then implemented onto Arduino boards witch attached RF-modules.

The protocol allows for usercode to be run along side the protocol and allows for different use-cases such as a fire alarm network or home automation.
